# NG2-TS-JSPM Seed

This repo contains the basic configuration files needed to get started with Angular 2 using TypeScript and JSPM.

Inspired by htdt's ng2-jspm, but updated and simplified for a more generic purpose.

To use it: clone this repo then run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g jspm live-server
npm install
jspm install
live-server

The following versions in use are:

* Angular2 vAlpha.33
* TypeScript v 1.5
* JSPM v .16.0-beta.3
